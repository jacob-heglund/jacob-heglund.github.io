## What do "you" do?

### Day-to-day actions

If we again consider our clone going a person's life, these actions are what you would see your clone doing if you let it loose on an average day. However, the actions a person takes on an average day are often correlated with the surrounding days, so it makes sense to take a step back at the "high-level" actions a person takes to better understand

### What drives day-to-day actions?

So then we may ask ourselves, during any particular period of time (say 1 month to several years) what am "I" doing on a day-to-day basis

Discipline, consistency, the problems you work to solve on a day-to-day basis, these are the things that define

Ideas are cheap. Anybody can daydream or fantasize, but what takes an idea from the abstract to the real world is a real commitment to the idea. Of course, this means choosing a single idea from an "ocean of ideas", which itself is not easy, but you should congratulate yourself when this is accomplished. You have taken the first vital step to take this idea from an abstraction in your head to an object that affects the real-world.

Step 1. Clearly articulate an idea and choose it as the best "current project" to work on compared to other ideas

It is now
bring this vision to fruition.


Bringing a vision to fruition is hard. we see this in entrepreneurship, artistry, and research where people have grandiose ideas, but not the ability to turn them into the real world in the form of products / services, artistic works, or a research paper. Similarly, people (or even corporations) may have ideals about who they are, but at the end of the day it is their actions that drive the essence of what they are. perhaps this is why Google recently removed their catchphras "Don't be evil", their actions are falling a bit far from the ideal of "not evil" (cite stuff about what they're doing in China in terms of supporting a government that squashes human rights)

People fill certain roles simultaneously (father, engineer, volunteer, husband). How you spend your time?
