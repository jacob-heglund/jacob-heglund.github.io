# Intro
Being self-isolated due to Coronavirus has given me plenty of uninterrupted time, so I'm writing down some ideas that I've been thinking about the past few years. These ideas are not totally original, and are heavily inspired by the podcasts I listen to (Tim Ferris, Joe Rogan, Jocko Willink to name a few), as well as books I've been reading (if you haven't read "Grit" by Angela Duckworth, the following ideas draw heavily from that source material). With that in mind, let's get into it.

## Who are you?
<!-- why is this important -->
Whether they know it or not, being able to answer this question is an important step in solving a lot of people's personal problems. The question "Who are you?" is one that almost everyone struggles with at certain times in their lives. People struggling to find purpose, struggling to find a path to follow, or dealing with malaise in their everyday life can all benefit from asking, and subsequently asking the question "Who are you?". Being able to clearly articulate an answer to this question is an important step to overcome unhappiness with our everyday lives. Once we have an answer to this question, we can choose to put ourselves in situations that best align with "who" we are, rather than putting ourselves in situations that do not align or are opposed to "who" we are.

<!-- what is the typical way people go about answering this question? Why does this fail? -->
This question appears deceptively easy when we first consider it.  If you ask a person "What do you do for a living?", you might get an answer like "student", "engineer", "nurse", etc. This answer will probably scratch the surface into who they are, but this relatively shallow description like a symptom of who you are, in the same way that a cough can be a symptom of an underlying health condition.  Chuck Palahniuk said it best in the book "Fight Club" through the character of Tyler Durden when he proclaims, *“You are not your job, you're not how much money you have in the bank. You are not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You are not your fucking khakis.”*


<!-- What is a better way to answer it? Oh, that way is pretty complicated so we'll get into the details here (and in the next few blog posts)-->
We have now established that the answer to the question "Who are you?" cannot be answered by asking ancillary questions, or questions that dance around the issue such as "What do you do for a living?", "What kind of car do you drive?", or, "Where did you grow up?". In fact, the answer to this question is simple; the answer to the question "Who are you?" is the definition of self. However, simple and easy are not the same thing, and being able to clearly define oneself and answer the question "Who are you?"

<!-- We must go into the definition of self -->

if they don't they may not have the self-awareness to realize that it is an important question seriously considering and coming to an acceptable answer.

Don't let situations around you define you, you define yourself by choosing how you prepare for and react to situations. You always have control of your definition of self, at the end of the day; you are the only person in the world with this power.

I hold a firm belief that a while a person may hold certain ideals or have ideas about who they think they are, it comes down to what they do, their actions, that define them.

## Who do you want to be?

A person may be defined differently to different people in their lives. For example, I am a much different person to my academic advisor than I am to my fiancée. I am a different person when I'm alone than when I'm with almost anybody in the world. So who am "I"? The most important "definition of self" is the one that you yourself perceive. That is, if you were able to completely detach from your actions and see how they affect others from a neutral, external perspective, what effects would your actions have on others. One way I like to think about this is to consider if I made an exact clone of yourself and let it run unimpeded in my life for a day. What would I see that clone do? What effect would that clone have on others on an average day?

Consider Uncle Rico from the classic film Napoleon Dynamite.  He thinks of himself as a football hotshot, but at the end of the day he is chasing a failed career that could have been. If Uncle Rico had the self awareness, that is, if he was able to detach from his actions on an average day of his life and see them from an external perspective, he might realize that his dreams of football greatness were not going anywhere.

Consider Lip from the TV show Shameless. In (this scene)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4Jbw63pAgU], to set up this scene, Lip is struggling with alcoholism and seeks the help of a sponsor in a coffee shop. Lip unconsciously defines himself by the things that are happening around him, his professor struggling with alcoholism and his ex girlfriend's new relationship, which

It is what you do. If you're following along, then we have just hit upon an important question. Leaving aside
