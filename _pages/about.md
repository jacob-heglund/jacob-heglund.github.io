## About

I am currently a PhD Student in the [Tran Research Group](https://sites.google.com/illinois.edu/tran-aerospace/home) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. We are studying applications of Machine Learning for improving autonomous systems and transportation infrastructure, as well as making contributions in algorithmic development.
